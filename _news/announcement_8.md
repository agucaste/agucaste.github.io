Happy to share that we just had a paper accepted with my dear friend and (now) co-author [Tom\'as Tapia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W2uXh4AAAAAJ&hl=en). Our work on [Reachability Guarantees on Energy Storage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12081) will be presented at the [2026 Power Systems Computation Conference](https://pscc2026.cy)
