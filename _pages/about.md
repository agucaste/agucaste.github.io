Hi there! I'm Agustin Castellano, a 4th year PhD student at Johns Hopkins University advised by prof. [Enrique Mallada](https://mallada.ece.jhu.edu). I mostly work on Reinforcement Learning algorithms for safety-critical systems, doing a healthy mix of theory and applications.
Prior to starting at Hopkins, I got the M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from [Universidad de la República](https://www.fing.edu.uy), Uruguay, under the guidance of prof. [Juan Bazerque](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/people/faculty/juan-bazerque-giusto/)

I'm building this webpage as we speak, so stay tuned!
